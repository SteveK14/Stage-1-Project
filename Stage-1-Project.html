        <span class="notetitle">World Wide Web</span><br>  <!-- Demonstrate <span> here? -->
        The world wide web is <span class="important">a collection of HyperText Markup Language,
        or HTML, documents.</span> There are approximately 30 billion web pages on the web 
        currently. HTML files are not the only files that can be found on the web; one can also 
        find files in the format of  Plain Text, Images, Video, and Music. When a person
        searches for a web page on the internet a HTTP request is sent to a server and the
        server relays the appropriate HTML information that is interpreted and displayed
        by a person's web browser.<br>
        A HTML file is made up of several parts: text content, markup, references, and links.
        The text content is what you see. The markup is what the file looks like. It may 
        conatain references to other documents, like images and videos. Finally, a HTML file 
        may contain links to other web pages.

      <p>
        <span class="notetitle">More About HTML</span><br>
        One can alter the function and how a HTML file looks by using different kind of tools,
        known as <em>Elements</em>. In this first lesson several kinds of <em>Tags</em> were demonstrated 
        from the <b>Bold Tag</b> and the <em>Emphasis Tag</em> to tags for anchoring links and 
        displaying images. The utilization of whitespace was also discussed via the introduction 
        of inline and block tags. <span class="important">An inline tag can be used in the line of text. 
        While a block tag creates an 'invisible box' between its opening and closing tags.</span> The next 
        tool used to alter an HTML file is known as an <em>Attributes</em>. Attributes are inserted into 
        tags and help alter the element's properties displayed on the page. There is more specific information
        about the specific tags and attributes used in this lesson linked at the bottom of the page.

        <span class="notetitle">Dumb Computer</span><br>
        "Computers are stupid." This means that computers won't ever do anything unless they are explicitly
        told to do it. It is important to remember this when writing code because the computer will execute
        code downt to the last notation; meaning that even a small mistake can keep a powerful program from
        operating correctly.

        <span class="notetitle">Why start with HTML and CSS</span><br>
        They are one of the few types of coding that everything is 'inherently visual'. This means you can immediately
        see what the code is doing on the web page in front of you.

        <span class="notetitle">How Webpages Work</span><br>
        A webpage consists of: <span class="important">HTML files as the structure for the site, CSS files style the 
        webpage, javascript create interactive components.</span> There are more tools that are used to put them all 
        together. All elements are rectangular and you can read the same text as on the page.

        <span class="notetitle">Page Structure</span><br>
        The sideways triangles mean the start of another HTML element. Styles alter the way the programmer wants
        the webpage to look. While HTML and CSS are both considered 'languages', they are responsible for different
        parts of a web page. DOM, or Document Object Model, is a reference to the tree-like structure of the page. The 
        box structure of a webpage helps to simplify the design process. Class attributes are labels on boxes to help 
        organize them. Name the boxes creatively so that you can remember which box is which.

      <p>
        <span class="notetitle">Styling With CSS</span><br>
        By using CSS, one can apply different colors and themes to blocks of HTML text. <span class="important">
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</span> the 'Cascading' part of this language means that the style will be applied 
        to that element and all of it's child elements (This is known as <em>Inheritance</em>). You can reference several 
        sheets per HTML file, but the most specific rules are the ones that are applied to every element. CSS generally takes 
        the form of <em>attribute:value</em>.

    <div class="notegroup3" id="lesson-1.3.2">
      <p>
        <span class="notetitle">Inheritance</span><br>
        This is <span class="important">the mechanism by which properties are applied to a specific element and its descendant elements.
        </span> This system relies on the document tree, or hierarchy of HTML elements based on where they are nested. Generally, 
        descendant elements inherit text-related properties but not box-related properties. For a list of specific properties that can 
        and cannot be inherited, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Inheritance">Inheritance</a> article
        on Wikipedia.

      <p>
        <span class="notetitle">div vs. span</span><br>
        Div tags separate blocks of HTML elements and are generally used for large areas of alterations and to create structure
        in the HTML file. Span tags can be used in line with the rest of the text to affect smaller groups of HTML elements as 
        opposed to the whole div section of elements. Span also can make large changes to the file without interrupting the structure
        of the whole file. 
      </p>

    <div class="notegroup3" id="lesson-1.3.4">
      <p>
        <span class="notetitle">ID's and Classes</span><br>
        ID's are used to uniquely identify an element on the webpage. ID's are not meant to be used multiple times on the same page.
        If one wants to identify elements that have similarities then they would use Classes. Classes help to avoid repetition of code
        on a webpage.

      <p>
        <span class="notetitle">Benefits of Avoiding Repetition</span><br>
        If you are using several similar ID's and want to change the format and need to change all of them, it is quicker and cleaner to
        change those IDs to a Class. You only have to make the change once as opposed to having to alter all of the similar IDs. It also
        helps to eliminate more mistakes that may occour in your code by decreasing the amount of code that is needed to be written.

      <p>
        <span class="notetitle">Page Semantics</span><br>
        It is important to note that, in general, all webpages and browsers try to keep the same format. This means <span class="important"> organization and Content Sectioning are vital to keeping an organized page.</span> Content Sectioning helps to highlight specific elements of the page against other parts; for example, the header tag will create a box and increase the size of the text betweent he opening
        and closing tags. This helps to draw attention to what the following text may be about and give the viewer a better idea of what
        they are about to read. Here is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Content_sectioning">webpage</a>
        that provides more information on the different kinds of Content Sections that are available to use.

    <div class="notegroup3" id="lesson-1.3.7">
      <p>
        <span class="notetitle">Boxes</span><br>
        The boxes that make up a webpage are broken down into a <span class="important"> margin, border, padding,
        and content.</span> Content is the images and text that sit at the center of the website. The padding clears the 
        area around the content. Border surrounds the padding and content. Margin is the outer layer and 
        is effectively the space between boxes. Keep in mind the actual width of the box is the combined pixels of all
        parts of the box and not just the content. You can limit the overall size of the box and border by using CSS
        box-sizing command. However you may need to include specific browser information with this command (webkit, 
        moz, ms). Setting the box size to percentages will help change the box based on the screen size. The flex element
        allows you to put boxes side by side on a page rather than just on top of each other. This 
        <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-4131369051/m-3642758701">page</a> provides a good
        summary for what was covered if  you need additional information. <span class="important">Images you want to use 
        must be included in the project folder so they display correctly when called. Always include an alt attribute so 
        that something displays if the image is not called correctly.</span>

        Five things to look for when refining your code are:<br>
        1. Find the natural boxes<br>2. Find repeated style and semantic elements<br>3. Write the HTML<br>4. Apply the
        styles from biggest to smallest in change<br>5. Fix the leftover issues.<br>Applications like Chrome's DevTools
        help to make altering the appearance of your webpage simpler.
